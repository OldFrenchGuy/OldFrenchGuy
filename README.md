- 👋 Hi, I’m @OldFrenchGuy
- 👀 I’m interested in creating very simple tools, an old fashion way of programming. Performance, simplicity is AMHO the best way to contruct complex information systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Symphony, SASS, Vue, JS ECS6, and much much more ! It's part of my search for a new job, althought.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything you might think I'm able to contribute.
- 📫 How to reach me : just send me an email
